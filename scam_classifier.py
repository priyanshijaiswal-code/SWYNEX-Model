"""
Scam Message Classifier — Task 2 Prototype
SWYNEX Technologies — Artificial Intelligence Internship

Integrates a TF-IDF + Logistic Regression model (scikit-learn) into a small
working prototype for the problem defined in Task 1: classifying SMS/text
messages as scam or legitimate, with a basic explainability layer showing
which words most influenced the prediction.
